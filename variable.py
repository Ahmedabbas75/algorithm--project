help_D = '''1-array number must be decimal only like this 1,2,3,4,5
2- array number must be decimal only not letters or symbols
3-array must not be empty and minimum size is two
4-vertices number must be decimal only not letter or symbols
5-nodes and weighte must be decimal only like 1,2,3

descri_D = '''This program was created for a specific purpose, which is for the user to enter a set of numbers and store them in a array, and a set of algorithms are applied to them in order to arrange them
1- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
2- The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (consideringascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
3- The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
        .The subarray which already sorted
        .The remaining subarray was unsorted
4- In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
5- Binary Search Given a sorted or nonsorted array of n elements,and number we we need to search it  and return the index of number in the array.
6-Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm Data Structure is find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph (network) and the cost of this MST.
